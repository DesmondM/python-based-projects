Networking Excellence: Building a Strong Value-Based Network in an Accelerating Digital World by David Olivencia:

In today’s fast-paced and ever-changing digital landscape, achieving success goes beyond mere knowledge or hard work; it also hinges on the connections you cultivate.
David Olivencia’s *Building a Strong Value-Based Network in an Accelerating Digital World* provides a timely and practical guide to networking, but with a unique perspective: it stresses the importance of forming authentic, value-driven relationships instead of merely increasing your list of contacts.
Olivencia, a well-respected technology executive and networker, contends that in a time when digital connections often feel shallow, the secret to distinguishing yourself and thriving lies in fostering meaningful, value-oriented relationships.

In a world where many connections can be short-lived, Olivencia highlights the significance of consistency.
According to Olivencia, regularly reaching out to your network is one of the best ways to demonstrate that you value those relationships.
Olivencia recognizes the influence of social media and digital platforms in broadening our connections, but he cautions against depending solely on these tools.
” While platforms like LinkedIn are excellent for making initial connections, Olivencia emphasizes the importance of moving beyond online interactions to foster deeper, face-to-face relationships whenever possible.

This concept of giving back is fundamental to Olivencia’s approach to networking.
